## deci seconds

Source: [etl_telemetry_deci](src/etl_telemetry_deci.py)
Query: [network_log.sql](queries/network_log.sql)

To analyze the deci second data we can use fewer features (because of sampling rate) like the `computing` features and `vehicle_ping`. Event `rtp` and `modem` features have to be removed. We collect other `networking` features from the `network_log` table where we subset the telemetry data into a series of spikes and we merge the network data information using the `timestamp` and the `vehicle_id`. We pivot the `network_log` table wrt to the modem name.
We also discard `ttl` and `interval_duration` for the low information contained.
We discard `packets` because the hava a correlation of 0.98 with `bytes`.

_time series of the most relevant features_

We see that the quantity of transmitted information slightly correlates between modems signalizing similar networking issues across operators. The correlation between bytes and arrival time is lower than expected

But in general modems have a different behaviors, cellular 3 is the most stable and transmits more data.

## session time

We see that some quantities are dependent from the `session_time` which is the time since the starting of the session. 

![session_correlation](img/session_correlation.png)
_correlation between the `session_time` and other features_

`ram` is steadly growing over `session_time` but it's value never gets critical

Session time doesn't seem to influence the number of spikes

## datasets

We prepare different datasets for different parts of the analysis:

* **latency set** complete august data: [etl_telemetry](src/etl_telemetry.py)
  * location
  * networking
  * vehicle dynamics
  * computing
* **spike set** subset of august data referring to spike events [etl_spike](src/etl_spike.py)
  * location
  * networking
  * vehicle dynamics
  * computing
  
The different sets have a different sampling of events, the `latency set` has few spike events while the `spike set` has all the perturbations before and after a disruption event. 

From the two dataset we can see the different feature distribution and feature importance.

## spike preprocessing

Query: [resample_1sec](queries/resample_1sec.sql)
Code: [etl_spikes](src/etl_spikes.py)

We resample **averaging 1 sec worth of data** but some fields are still uncomplete, around 1% of the timse

![feature_missing](img/feature_missing.png)
_percentage of missing data in certain features_

We identify the peak and split each time series in sub series where all peaks are aligned at the minute 4 and we leave one minute after the spike. 

We artificially exagerate the peak to help the model understand it and set the peak max value to a plateau

![spike_events](img/spike_events2.png)
_series of spikes_

We than abstract the time and create a stack of series where the peak in phase

![spike_stack](img/spike_stack.png)
_stack of spikes where the spike happens at minute 4_

## spike inspection

It is interesting to analyze some spike series to understand qualitatively what might happen during incidents. In this case we see two concurrent spikes in two different sessions

![spike_simultaneous](img/spike_simultaneous.png)
_two spikes at the same time on different cars (*24, *76)_

Averaging the two series it seems that the `room_cpu` has a clear variation prior to the spike. 

![series_simultaneous](img/series_simultaneous.png)
_average of both time series prior to the spike_

We see 3 of such pairs: 2020-08-17T11, 2020-08-24T18, 2020-08-20T08.

## feature selection

At first we discard poor features analyzing:

* low variance
* low frequency
* noise level

Spikes are rare events and some features might be as rare as spikes and than a indication of them but in case of `['td_brake','td_throttle','steering_interval']` we see that data are rare don't happen in high latency cases.

![poor_feature](img/poor_feature.png)
_poor features_

In comparison we see that `rtp_lost` and `rtp_late` have a clear distribution dinstinction although most of the time data are NaNs

![rich_feature](img/rtp_pairplot.png)
_poor features but discriminators for latency_

## feature statistics

Code: [stat_telemetry](src/stat_telemetry.py), [stat_latency](src/stat_latency).

Of the most important feature we visualize the time series

![series_log](img/latency_series.png "time series")
_visualization of the time series_

We collect a day of data and subset the time series prior to a spike

![time_series](img/spike_series.png "time series")
_time series of the most relevant features prior to a spike, we can see that after the disruption the vehicle brakes_

We removed some features because of the obvious cross correlation (ex: `brake_pressure` ~ `wheel_speed`)

![computing_correlation](img/dynamics_correlation.png "feature correlation")
_feature correlation, obvious cross correlation_

We see a dependency between `vehicle` and `control_room` `cpu` and `ram` usage

![vehicle_room](img/computing_correlation.png)
_vehicle and control room interdependency on computation_

We see that not all the features are distributed regularly and some are pretty noisy. 

![feat_boxplot](img/latency_boxplot.png "feature boxplot")
_distribution of the latency features: boxplots_

In case of the spike subset the distribution get a bit broader

![feat_boxplot](img/spike_boxplot.png "feature boxplot")
_distribution of the spike features: boxplots_

We than calculate the logaritmic of the most dispersed features (e.g. `_force_`) to gain more meaningful information. Changing the latencies to their logaritmic value doesn't change much the distributions

![feat_boxplot](img/feat_boxplot.png "feature boxplot")
_logaritmic transformation for some features_

We see that some quantities are bimodal, interestingly latencies too. It seems there are clear distinguished operating regimes.

![feat_joyplot](img/latency_joyplot.png "feature joyplot")
_distribution of the latency features: joyplots_

Another feature selection takes more into account the networking features, the different time frames change a lot the data distribution. In this case we consider only events in the proximity of a spike and the features become even more bimodal

![feat_joyplot](img/spike_joyplot.png "feature joyplot")
_distribution of the spike features: joyplots_

Looking at the pair plot we see that only `ram_usage` has an interesting dependency on the `camera_latency`, the **purple set is the one corresponding to the larger bin of the `camera_latency`

We analyze the how the networing features distributes in different regimes of camera latency

![feat_pairplot](img/networking_pairplot.png)
_pairplot of the networking features_

Same for the computing features

Pairplot for vehicle dynamics features don't show a clear dependency on latency

## latency statistical properties

We want to understand the periodicity and auto correlation of `camera_latency` to understand how to separate different regimes 

![latency_decay](img/latency_decay.png)
_latency decays and frequency behaviour_

We analyze the power spectrum for a normal latency or during a spike

![latency_spectrum](img/latency_spectrum.png)
_latency power spectrum for normal and spike regimes_

During the spike event autocorrelation is a bit larger and more stable than in the normal regime

## feature normalization

For a fast and reliable training a good normalization is essential for the performances of the predictions. We need to find a stable normalization to keep across all predictions. If we need to change the normalization than we need to retrain the model.
