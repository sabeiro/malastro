## latency prediction

We want to distinguish the camera latency into different danger classes and be able to predict them depending on the other parameters.

If we use 2 or 5 classes the results are different

_prediction on two classes_

Perfomances decrese when we want to increase the number of classes

If we consider only the incident set we see that training is more difficult

The confusion matrix shows really few counts outside of the diagonal

### feature importance

Iterating over different models we see different performances and feature importance. Despite differences we see that most of the model consider modem issues as the most relevant for spike prediction

Running a simple regression results are pretty clear

## spike prediction

Code: [train_spike](src/train_spike.py).

We want to understand which are the most important predictors for camera latency.

We create the most simple regressor as **baseline model** to set the reference performance to test other models

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(layer[0],input_shape=(n_feat,),kernel_initializer='normal',activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='normal'))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
```

We train the model on the complete dataset and than iterate for each single series

We see that in the baseline model only a peak is predicted.

With a deeper network few peaks more are detected.
